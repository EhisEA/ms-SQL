Border Color
The color of a border can also be customized with the border-color property.
div.container {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 3px;
  border-color: rgb(22, 77, 100);
}

The border-color property accepts colors in the various formats you learned about earlier: named colors, RGB(a) colors, and hex colors. It's common to use hex colors for borders, but you'll likely also come across RGB(a) colors as well.
